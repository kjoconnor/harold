<p class="error"><strong>Please use GitHub's native review UI whenever
possible.</strong> It's much easier to understand and works with non-Harold
tools (like GitHub itself).</p>

<p>Harold implements the entirely made up Code Salon Review Methodâ„¢. This
consists of a few emoji that are used to indicate states of the review process.
Those emoji are, in roughly the order they'd be seen in review:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>{{ emoji["eyeglasses"] }} (<code>:eyeglasses:</code>)</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Followed by a list of @github-username mentions, this means "[mentioned
    users] please review this pull request".</p>

    <p>This is for initial review requests, not pinging people to come back like
    <code>:haircut:</code>.</p>

    <p><i>Used by authors, but also reviewers when they want to summon other
      people.</i></p>
  </dd>

  <dt>{{ emoji["nail_care"] }} (<code>:nail_care:</code>)</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This means "I've finished my review pass and am awaiting your
    responses."</p>

    <p><i>Used by reviewers.</i></p>
  </dd>

  <dt>{{ emoji["haircut"] }} (<code>:haircut:</code>)</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This means "I've responded or made appropriate changes and am ready for
    further review."</p>

    <p>This doesn't accept usernames like <code>:eyeglasses:</code>, it just
    pings everyone who has reviewed so far. Use the GitHub review UI if you
    want to be more granular.</p>

    <p><i>Used by authors.</i></p>
  </dd>

  <dt>{{ emoji["fish"] }} (<code>:fish:</code>)</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This means "I think this pull request is ready for merge."</p>

    <p>It's also OK to use this if the pull request is nearly ready to unblock
    the author when they make some final touchups.</p>

    <p><i>Used by reviewers.</i></p>
  </dd>

  <dt>{{ emoji["running"] }} (<code>:running:</code>)</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This means "I don't have time to review this at the moment, please find
    someone else."</p>

    <p>Do this to be clear to authors that you aren't blocking their progress.
    But remember that code review is important and your input is helpful.</p>

    <p><i>Used by reviewers.</i></p>
  </dd>

  <dt>{{ emoji["no_bell"] }} (<code>:no_bell:</code>)</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>When prefixing a comment, this means "This is just a comment and
    requires no action."</p>

    <p><i>Used by reviewers.</i></p>
  </dd>
